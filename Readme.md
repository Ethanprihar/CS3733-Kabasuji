Kabasuji is a interactive game where the player must fill a board with pieces that are provided for them in the bullpen. There are three different kinds of levels in Kabasuji; Puzzle Mode, Release Mode, and Lightning Mode.

Kabasuji Start Up:

  When the opening screen starts up hit the "Select Level" button to select a level to play. 

Selecting a Level:

  This will bring you to the level select page where you can click on a level to start playing that level.  Lightning levels are indicated by a small storm cloud, Puzzle levels are indicated by a small puzzle piece below the level and the icon with three colored tiles is used to indicate a Release level.  

  NOTE: Only 15 levels can be displayed in the level select at a time, so in order to see another level delete some of the levels that currently exist.

Playing a Puzzle Level:

  Puzzle Mode is the normal playing mode of the game where pieces can be moved from the bullpen to the board score stars. Stars are scored based on how much of the board is covered by pieces. Pieces are not allowed to overlap each other on the board.  A player only has a limited number of moves.
